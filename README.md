A simple application that helps you keep track of and manage your goals.

## Features

- You can enter a goal along with a corresponding date range for when you want to start the goal and when you want to complete it by.
- There is a progress bar for each goal that shows the percentage of its total duration that has already elapsed.
- There is a live-editing functionality that lets you change the name of the goal directly on the text itself.

## Purpose

While teaching myself how to code, I learned that it's important to set your own deadlines for goals or projects in order to maximize your productivity given that no one else is holding you accountable.

It helps a lot to compare how much actual work you produced to the amount of time you have left in order to know when you have to pick up the pace and by how much.

I built this to help me be more productive but hopefully it can do the same for you!
